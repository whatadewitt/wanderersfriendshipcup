        <h2>The FDSA Wanderers Senior Men's Team</h2>
        <p>
          The Wanderers formed in 2002 as group of young, community-minded
          soccer players who wanted a place to play and a club atmosphere in
          which to have fun. Our team now consists of over 50 current players
          from around the Fredericton area, and an even larger number of
          Wanderers alumni who remain loyal to our club. We boast of a 2013
          Challenge Cup winning “Senior A” team that played in the NBPSL  as
          well as a second division team that also captured its respective
          provincial title in 2012 and 2013 as well as winning multiple
          F.S.S.L. league and playoff titles over the years. Our philosophy is
          to strive for excellence in both sport and community involvement, and
          we are proud to announce ourselves as "Your Team in the Fredericton
          Community".
        </p>
        <p>
          After operating independently for 12 years, the Wanderers, in 2013
          were proud to partner with the Fredericton District Soccer Association
          and support all the work that the FDSA does to promote positive youth
          development in the capital region.

        <h2>The Wanderers Development Group</h2>
        <h3>
          ...committed to youth development and community enhancement through
          sport.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In 2013, a group of 6 has been soccer players (Now called The
          Wanderers Development Group) wanted to give back, not only to our
          local soccer community but to a greater cause in The Gambia. We had
          come in contact to a dedicated group of volunteers in Brikama who were
          committed to youth development and community improvement through
          sport. It was impossible for us to not be inspired by the work these
          volunteers were doing in their community and so the two groups decided
          to create sister tournaments to be run in Fredericton, NB and Brikama
          in the Gambia called the Wanderers Friendship Cup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six years later we are both still running our concurrent soccer
          tournaments. Last year’s tournament in Brikama hosted 20 football
          academies and four schools participated in the girls category. Back
          here in Fredericton we hosted 20 boys and girls team at the U12
          Division 1 level. The Organizing Committees on both sides of the Ocean
          aim to ensure that the Friendship Cup presents an opportunity for
          friendly competition - and we hope that through this - coaches and
          parents will see their children grow as players, teammates, and
          leaders. In addition to playing and competing (win or lose), we also
          place an enormous value on knowing that friendships grow throughout
          the weekend, and frankly across the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through funds raised organizing our local tournament, we have been
          able to send over $14,000 in financial assistance to help our friends
          run their tournament. This would not be possible without our two main
          tournament sponsors, the Fredericton Inn and all four of the
          Fredericton area Y’s men clubs. We have also worked with our local
          soccer association, The FDSA, to send lightly used jerseys and balls.
