          The FDSA Wanderers and the Fredericton Wanderers of Brikama
          partnership began in March 2011 while Wanderers co-founder Matt
          DeCourcey was working with the Nova Scotia-Gambia Association (NSGA)
          -- a leading organization with 30 years of the on-the-ground
          health-education work in The Gambia.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working with the NSGA in The Gambia in the winter of 2010-11,
          DeCourcey developed a close bond with his colleague, NSGA Trainer
          Jerreh Manneh, and the Brikama football (soccer) team that Manneh
          managed. Prior to his return to Canada, DeCourcey left his Gambian
          counterparts with a nominal sum of seed money for their upcoming
          season, and a promise to work together to provide opportunities for
          young Gambians to play soccer.

          In August 2011, the FDSA Wanderers sent $350 and two sets of Wanderers
          jerseys to their Gambian partners to help fund their season, and to
          use for community outreach initiatives with youth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In July 2012, with the support of Randall Hazlett of Investors Group,
          the FDSA Wanderers raised $1000 for the inaugural tournament. In
          February 2013, the Fredericton District Soccer Association donated an
          additional $500 and sets of jerseys and cleats to the initiative. The
          McCain New Brunswick Premier Soccer League donated a trophy that will
          remain in The Gambia for future competitions. Eight under-15 boys
          teams competed over three weekends in the inaugural Wanderers
          Friendship Cup May 2013, in Brikama, The Gambia. The young soccer
          players also took part in health-education programming delivered by
          the young Peer-Health Educators trained by the NSGA.

          &ldquo;During my time in The Gambia, I asked many people what young
          Gambian soccer players needed most. The answer was simple. They don’t
          want better equipment. They don’t need better fields. All young
          Gambians want is more opportunities for competition and to
          play.&rdquo;

        <h3>2019 Update</h3>
        <p>
          The Wanderers Development Association in the Gambia, led by our friend
          Jerreh Manneh, has recently completed hosting the 7th edition of The
          Wanderers Friendship Cup. The association remains as committed as ever
          to youth development and community improvement through sport. This
          year’s tournament, in partnership with West Coast Region Football
          Academies Association and the Gambia Senior Secondary Schools Sports
          Committee (LOC) hosted the tournament into two regions (West Coast
          Region and Lower River Region) culminating in the final at the Brikama
          Mini Stadium. In the future, they hope to expand the tournament into
          other regions of the Gambia, provide transport for the teams from the
          remote communities and provide support for coaching education.

        <h3>Health Education</h3>
        <p>
          We are particularly proud of the work being done, in part through our
          yearly financial commitment to our friends in Brikama, to be able to
          continue to conduct health education as part of the promoting health
          lifestyle and lifesaving skills for your people for them to live for a
          better. This was conducted through Drama and presentation at the
          football field before and after football matches and they provide
          training for girls at their various schools on Reproductive Health and
          Life Skills. The tournament provides young Gambians with live-saving
          skills and knowledge, enabling them to live healthier and happier
          lives, as well as providing them with the opportunity to enjoy their
          right to play. With the ongoing support provided from the Fredericton
          tournament, the Wanderers Development Association in the Gambia hope
          to increase educational programs to cover teenage pregnancy and other
          health issues including drug abuse.
